# Poke'Times
A very basic app I built during a [React course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG) to practice React Router and higher order components.

## Installation
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which comes with npm) installed on your computer. From your command line: 
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/moaaz-bhnas/poketimes.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd poketimes

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
